Notes:
kind container:

Uses the kindest/node image to set up a Kubernetes cluster.
Exposes the Kubernetes API server on port 6443.
Mounts a volume kind-data for Docker-in-Docker.


python-client container:

Builds from a Dockerfile located in the python-client directory.
Installs necessary Python dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
Contains a client.py script to interact with the Kubernetes API.


KUBECONFIG:

The KUBECONFIG environment variable is set to /root/.kube/config to allow the Python client to find the Kubernetes configuration.


Dependencies:

The python-client service depends on the kind service, ensuring that the kind cluster is up and running before the Python client starts.


To get this working:

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
Create the necessary directory structure and files as outlined above.
Run docker-compose up --build to start the services.
This setup will spin up a kind Kubernetes cluster and a Python client that interacts with the cluster via API calls.
